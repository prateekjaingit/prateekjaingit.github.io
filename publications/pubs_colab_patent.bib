abstract = {Systems and methods for entity recommendation can make use of rich data by allowing the items to be recommended and the recipients of the recommendation (eg, users) to be modeled as “complex entities” composed of one or more static sub-entities and/or a dynamic component, and by utilizing information about multiple relationships between the sub-entities as reflected in bipartite graphs. Generating recommendations from such information may involve creating vector representations of the sub-entities based on the bipartite graphs (eg, using graph-based convolutional networks), and combining these vector representations into representations of the items and users (or other recipients) to be fed into a classifier model.},

abstract = {A computing device includes a storage machine holding instructions executable by a logic machine to generate multi-string clusters, each containing alphanumeric strings of a dataset. Further multi-string clusters are generated via iterative performance of a combination operation in which a hierarchically-superior cluster is generated from a set of multi-string clusters. The combination operation includes, for candidate pairs of multi-string clusters, generating syn tactic profiles describing an alphanumeric string from each multi-string cluster of the candidate pair. For each of the candidate pairs, a cost factor is determined for at least one of its syntactic profiles. Based on the cost factors determined for the syntactic profiles, one of the candidate pairs is selected. The multi-string clusters from the selected candi date pair are combined to generate the hierarchically-supe rior cluster including all of the alphanumeric strings …},

abstract = {Systems, methods, and computer-executable instructions for guiding program synthesis includes receiving a specification that includes an input and output example. Programs are synthesized that meet the specification. During synthesizing each of the programs includes branching decisions. Each branching decision includes a plurality of paths. Synthesizing the programs comprises includes selecting a first score model, for a first branching decision. Each of the programs is scored using the first score model. The paths of the first branching decision are pared based on the score. One the paths is selected. A synthesized program that meets the specification is returned. The synthesized program includes the one of the paths.},
