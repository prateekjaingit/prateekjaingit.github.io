Standard personalization approaches involve learning a user/domain specific\\emph {embedding} that is fed into a fixed global model which can be limiting. On the other hand, personalizing/fine-tuning model itself for each user/domain\u2014aka meta-learning\u2014has high storage/infrastructure cost. Moreover, rigorous theoretical studies of scalable personalization approaches have been very limited. To address the above issues, we propose a novel meta-learning style approach that models network weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse components. This captures common information from multiple individuals/users together in the low-rank part while sparse part captures user-specific idiosyncrasies. We then study the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating the sum of a rank- and a -column sparse matrix using a small number of linear measurements. We propose a computationally efficient alternating minimization method with iterative hard thresholding\u2014AMHT-LRS\u2014to learn the low-rank and sparse part. Theoretically, for the realizable Gaussian data setting, we show that AMHT-LRS solves the problem efficiently with nearly optimal sample complexity. Finally, a significant challenge in personalization is ensuring privacy of each user\u2019s sensitive data. We alleviate this problem by proposing a differentially private variant of our method that also is equipped with strong generalization guarantees.", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Sample-Efficient Personalization: Modeling User Parameters as Low Rank Plus Sparse Components", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=12248542259396760880&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "S Pal, P Varshney, G Madan, P Jain, A Thakurta\u2026 - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and \u2026, 2024", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:MFW0E0qQ-6kJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=12248542259396760880", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=12248542259396760880&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "12248542259396760880"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "664118250a90c707b8349665", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/91642cf7f48389af/664118250a90c707b8349665.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:27:33 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:27:33 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:rLGzs9wiiwIC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/91642cf7f48389af/664118250a90c707b8349665.html", "total_time_taken": 0.75}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:rLGzs9wiiwIC"}, "citation": {"title": "Gecko: Versatile text embeddings distilled from large language models", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20327", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20327"}], "authors": "Jinhyuk Lee, Zhuyun Dai, Xiaoqi Ren, Blair Chen, Daniel Cer, Jeremy R Cole, Kai Hui, Michael Boratko, Rajvi Kapadia, Wen Ding, Yi Luan, Sai Meher Karthik Duddu, Gustavo Hernandez Abrego, Weiqiang Shi, Nithi Gupta, Aditya Kusupati, Prateek Jain, Siddhartha Reddy Jonnalagadda, Ming-Wei Chang, Iftekhar Naim", "publication_date": "2024/3/29", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.20327", "description": "We present Gecko, a compact and versatile text embedding model.

However, exploiting this sparsity for improving latency is hindered by the fact that identifying top rows/columns is data-dependent and is usually performed using full matrix operations, severely limiting potential gains. To address these issues, we introduce HiRE (High Recall Approximate Top-k Estimation). HiRE comprises of two novel components: (i) a compression scheme to cheaply predict top- rows/columns with high recall, followed by full computation restricted to the predicted subset, and (ii) DA-TOP-: an efficient multi-device approximate top- operator. We demonstrate that on a one billion parameter model, HiRE applied to both the softmax as well as feedforward layers, achieves almost matching pretraining and downstream accuracy, and speeds up inference latency by on a single TPUv5e device.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 1, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=8198853413902406113&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=8198853413902406113&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "8198853413902406113"}, "table": [{"year": 2024, "citations": 1}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "HiRE: High Recall Approximate Top-$ k $ Estimation for Efficient LLM Inference", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=8198853413902406113&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "V Yerram, C You, S Bhojanapalli, S Kumar, P Jain\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.09360, 2024", "cited_by": {"total": 1, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=8198853413902406113&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=8198853413902406113&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "8198853413902406113"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:4dEmlb0tyHEJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=8198853413902406113", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=8198853413902406113&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "8198853413902406113"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a20f55d77345fdc426c", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/61cf8f60f1dbf974/66411a20f55d77345fdc426c.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:00 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:00 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/61cf8f60f1dbf974/66411a20f55d77345fdc426c.html", "total_time_taken": 1.11}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC"}, "citation": {"title": "Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08644", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644"}], "authors": "Pranav Ajit Nair, Yashas Samaga, Toby Boyd, Sanjiv Kumar, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli", "publication_date": "2024/2/13", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.08644", "description": "The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations. We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=9514727479110843524&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "PA Nair, Y Samaga, T Boyd, S Kumar, P Jain\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.08644, 2024", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:hLwMJzsaC4QJ:scholar.google.com/"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a213e86acaf71fa3059", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/f4098ee428718deb/66411a213e86acaf71fa3059.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:01 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:01 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:bVQMTfhMCi4C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/f4098ee428718deb/66411a213e86acaf71fa3059.html", "total_time_taken": 0.92}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:bVQMTfhMCi4C"}, "citation": {"title": "Label Robust and Differentially Private Linear Regression: Computational and Statistical Efficiency", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/47e74fca60b4af4846b7abab188b85f2-Abstract-Conference.html", "resources": [{"title": "from neurips.cc", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/47e74fca60b4af4846b7abab188b85f2-Paper-Conference.pdf"}], "authors": "Xiyang Liu, Prateek Jain, Weihao Kong, Sewoong Oh, Arun Suggala", "publication_date": "2024/2/13", "journal": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "volume": "36", "description": "We study the canonical problem of linear regression under -differential privacy when the datapoints are sampled iid~ from a distribution and a fraction of response variables are adversarially corrupted.

To accurately capture tail queries and data points, learned representations typically are _rigid, high-dimensional_ vectors that are generally used as-is in the entire ANNS pipeline and can lead to computationally expensive retrieval. In this paper, we argue that instead of rigid representations, different stages of ANNS can leverage _adaptive representations_ of varying capacities to achieve significantly better accuracy-compute trade-offs, ie, stages of ANNS that can get away with more approximate computation should use a lower-capacity representation of the same data point. To this end, we introduce AdANNS, a novel ANNS design framework that explicitly leverages the flexibility of Matryoshka Representations. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-compute trade-offs using novel AdANNS-based key ANNS building blocks like search data structures (AdANNS-IVF) and quantization (AdANNS-OPQ). For example on ImageNet retrieval, AdANNS-IVF is up to % more accurate than the rigid representations-based IVF at the same compute budget; and matches accuracy while being up to faster in _wall-clock time_. For Natural Questions, -byte AdANNS-OPQ matches the accuracy of the -byte OPQ baseline constructed using rigid representations--_same accuracy at half the cost! _ We further show that the gains from AdANNS translate to modern-day composite ANNS indices that combine search structures and quantization.

On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 12, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=3668029210306898471&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=3668029210306898471&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "3668029210306898471"}, "table": [{"year": 2024, "citations": 12}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Llm augmented llms: Expanding capabilities through composition", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=3668029210306898471&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "R Bansal, B Samanta, S Dalmia, N Gupta, S Vashishth\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.02412, 2024", "cited_by": {"total": 12, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=3668029210306898471&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=3668029210306898471&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "3668029210306898471"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:J2oZ-iF15zIJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=3668029210306898471", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=3668029210306898471&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "3668029210306898471"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a3afdca3eab2cea3d8f", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4db607d056def701/66411a3afdca3eab2cea3d8f.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:26 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:26 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4db607d056def701/66411a3afdca3eab2cea3d8f.html", "total_time_taken": 0.16}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:yeL6HyUMUGUC"}, "citation": {"title": "Attention neural networks with tree attention mechanisms", "link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240005131A1/en", "inventors": "Himanshu Jain, Lovish Madaan, Prateek Jain, Venkata Sesha Pavana Srinadh Bhojanapalli", "publication_date": "2024/1/4", "patent_office": "US", "application_number": "18343723", "description": "Systems and methods for processing inputs using attention neural networks with tree attention layers.

The diverse inference constraints in these scenarios necessitate practitioners to train foundation models such as PaLM 2, Llama, & ViTs as a series of models of varying sizes.

This work introduces MatFormer, a nested Transformer architecture designed to offer elasticity in a variety of deployment constraints. Each Feed Forward Network (FFN) block of a MatFormer model is jointly optimized with a few nested smaller FFN blocks. This training procedure allows for the Mix'n'Match of model granularities across layers -- i.e., a trained universal MatFormer model enables extraction of hundreds of accurate smaller models, which were never explicitly optimized. We empirically demonstrate MatFormer's effectiveness across different model classes (decoders & encoders), modalities (language & vision), and scales (up to 2.6B parameters). We find that a 2.6B decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM) allows us to extract smaller models spanning from 1.5B to 2.6B, each exhibiting comparable validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations to their independently trained counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that smaller encoders extracted from a universal MatFormer-based ViT (MatViT) encoder preserve the metric-space structure for adaptive large-scale retrieval. Finally, we showcase that speculative decoding with the accurate and \u2026", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=5771251231597276327&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=5771251231597276327&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "5771251231597276327"}, "table": [{"year": 2024, "citations": 2}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Matformer: Nested transformer for elastic inference", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=5771251231597276327&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "F Devvrit, S Kudugunta, A Kusupati, T Dettmers\u2026 - Workshop on Advancing Neural Network Training \u2026, 2023", "cited_by": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=5771251231597276327&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=5771251231597276327&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "5771251231597276327"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:pyzk8GqaF1AJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=5771251231597276327", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=5771251231597276327&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "5771251231597276327"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a40edb0346b78fff80c", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/694416dd6af7989d/66411a40edb0346b78fff80c.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:32 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:32 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:tz746QTLzJkC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/694416dd6af7989d/66411a40edb0346b78fff80c.html", "total_time_taken": 2.27}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:tz746QTLzJkC"}, "citation": {"title": "Efficacy of dual-encoders for extreme multi-label classification", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10636", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10636"}], "authors": "Nilesh Gupta, Devvrit Khatri, Ankit S Rawat, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Prateek Jain, Inderjit S Dhillon", "publication_date": "2023/10/16", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.10636", "description": "Dual-encoder models have demonstrated significant success in dense retrieval tasks for open-domain question answering that mostly involves zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. However, their performance in many-shot retrieval problems where training data is abundant, such as extreme multi-label classification (XMC), remains under-explored. Existing empirical evidence suggests that, for such problems, the dual-encoder method's accuracies lag behind the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) extreme classification methods that grow the number of learnable parameters linearly with the number of classes. As a result, some recent extreme classification techniques use a combination of dual-encoders and a learnable classification head for each class to excel on these tasks. In this paper, we investigate the potential of \"pure\" DE models in XMC tasks. Our findings reveal that when trained correctly standard dual-encoders can match or outperform SOTA extreme classification methods by up to 2% at Precision@1 even on the largest XMC datasets while being 20x smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. We further propose a differentiable topk error-based loss function, which can be used to specifically optimize for Recall@k metrics.

Such techniques use a two-stage process: (a) contrastive learning to train a dual encoder to embed both the query and documents and (b) approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) for finding similar documents for a given query. These two stages are disjoint; the learned embeddings might be ill-suited for the ANNS method and vice-versa, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose End-to-end Hierarchical Indexing -- EHI -- that jointly learns both the embeddings and the ANNS structure to optimize retrieval performance. EHI uses a standard dual encoder model for embedding queries and documents while learning an inverted file index (IVF) style tree structure for efficient ANNS. To ensure stable and efficient learning of discrete tree-based ANNS structure, EHI introduces the notion of dense path embedding that captures the position of a query/document in the tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EHI on several benchmarks, including de-facto industry standard MS MARCO (Dev set and TREC DL19) datasets. For example, with the same compute budget, EHI outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) in by 0.6% (MRR@10) on MS MARCO dev set and by 4.2% (nDCG@10) on TREC DL19 benchmarks.", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "EHI: End-to-end Learning of Hierarchical Index for Efficient Dense Retrieval", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=4272204947142071636&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "R Kumar, A Mittal, N Gupta, A Kusupati, I Dhillon\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.08891, 2023", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:VNURqsPrSTsJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=4272204947142071636", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=4272204947142071636&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "4272204947142071636"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a4937b24a399d3100d2", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4aab07ecaedee605/66411a4937b24a399d3100d2.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:41 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:41 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:7H_jS4BsgvYC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4aab07ecaedee605/66411a4937b24a399d3100d2.html", "total_time_taken": 0.28}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:7H_jS4BsgvYC"}, "citation": {"title": "MatFormer: Nested Transformer for Elastic Inference", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07707"}], "authors": "Sneha Kudugunta, Aditya Kusupati, Tim Dettmers, Kaifeng Chen, Inderjit Dhillon, Yulia Tsvetkov, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Sham Kakade, Ali Farhadi, Prateek Jain", "publication_date": "2023/10/11", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.07707", "description": "Transformer models are deployed in a wide range of settings, from multi-accelerator clusters to standalone mobile phones.

Tasks that have much fewer data samples than others are more susceptible to the noise added for privacy. It is natural to ask whether algorithms can adapt to this skew to improve the overall utility. We give a systematic analysis of the problem, by studying how to optimally allocate a user\u2019s privacy budget among tasks. We propose a generic algorithm, based on an adaptive reweighting of the empirical loss, and show that in the presence of distribution skew, this gives a quantifiable improvement of excess empirical risk.

We address this problem by providing an end-to-end technique that optimizes for model's Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) or for on-device latency via a novel latency surrogate. Our algorithm is versatile and can be used with many popular compression methods including pruning, low-rank factorization, and quantization. Crucially, it is fast and runs in almost the same amount of time as single model training; which is a significant training speed-up over standard NAS methods. For BERT compression on GLUE fine-tuning tasks, we achieve reduction in FLOPs with only drop in performance. For compressing MobileNetV3 on ImageNet-1K, we achieve reduction in FLOPs, and reduction in on-device latency without drop in accuracy, while still requiring less training compute than SOTA compression techniques. Finally, for transfer learning on smaller datasets, our technique identifies - cheaper architectures than standard MobileNetV3, EfficientNet suite of architectures at almost the same training cost and accuracy.", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "End-to-End Neural Network Compression via $\\frac {\\ell_1}{\\ell_2} $ Regularized Latency Surrogates", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=17490051463230994118&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "A Nasery, H Shah, AS Suggala, P Jain - arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05785, 2023", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:xjYvuSMlufIJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=17490051463230994118", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=17490051463230994118&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "17490051463230994118"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a51cace96fb323e0fd3", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/d95fc011b0ee5b75/66411a51cace96fb323e0fd3.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:49 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:49 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/d95fc011b0ee5b75/66411a51cace96fb323e0fd3.html", "total_time_taken": 0.41}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:pYKElYtJMmwC"}, "citation": {"title": "Optimal algorithms for latent bandits with cluster structure", "link": "https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/pal23a.html", "resources": [{"title": "from mlr.press", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/pal23a/pal23a.pdf"}], "authors": "Soumyabrata Pal, Arun Sai Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain", "publication_date": "2023/4/11", "conference": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics", "pages": "7540-7577", "publisher": "PMLR", "description": "We consider the problem of latent bandits with cluster structure where there are multiple users, each with an associated multi-armed bandit problem. These users are grouped into latent clusters such that the mean reward vectors of users within the same cluster are identical. At each round, a user, selected uniformly at random, pulls an arm and observes a corresponding noisy reward. The goal of the users is to maximize their cumulative rewards. This problem is central to practical recommendation systems and has received wide attention of late Gentile et al.(2014), Maillard and Mannor (2014). Now, if each user acts independently, then they would have to explore each arm independently and a regret of is unavoidable, where M, N are the number of arms and users, respectively. Instead, we propose LATTICE (Latent bAndiTs via maTrIx ComplEtion) which allows exploration of the latent cluster structure to provide the minimax optimal regret of when the number of clusters is . This is the first algorithm to guarantee such strong regret bound. LATTICE is based on a careful exploitation of arm information within a cluster while simultaneously clustering users. Furthermore, it is computationally efficient and requires only calls to an offline matrix completion oracle across all T rounds.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=9755051290853975692&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=9755051290853975692&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "9755051290853975692"}, "table": [{"year": 2024, "citations": 4}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Optimal algorithms for latent bandits with cluster structure", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=9755051290853975692&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "S Pal, AS Suggala, K Shanmugam, P Jain - International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and \u2026, 2023", "cited_by": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=9755051290853975692&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=9755051290853975692&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "9755051290853975692"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:jCYR7XbnYIcJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=9755051290853975692", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=9755051290853975692&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "9755051290853975692"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a521baebbe6e6e98bae", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/af8503d344aabd86/66411a521baebbe6e6e98bae.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:50 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:36:50 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:Vr2j17o0sqMC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/af8503d344aabd86/66411a521baebbe6e6e98bae.html", "total_time_taken": 0.87}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:Vr2j17o0sqMC"}, "citation": {"title": "Near optimal private and robust linear regression", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13273", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13273"}], "authors": "Xiyang Liu, Prateek Jain, Weihao Kong, Sewoong Oh, Arun Sai Suggala", "publication_date": "2023/1/30", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.13273", "description": "We study the canonical statistical estimation problem of linear regression from i.i.d.~examples under -differential privacy when some response variables are adversarially corrupted.

When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context rigid, fixed capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer:(a) up to smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy;(b) up to real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities--vision (ViT, ResNet), vision+ language (ALIGN) and language (BERT).

Existing meta-learning techniques use two complementary approaches of either learning a low-dimensional representation of points for all tasks, or task-specific fine-tuning of a global model trained using all the tasks. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that combines both the techniques to enable handling of a large number of data-starved tasks. Our framework models network weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse matrices. This allows us to capture information from multiple domains together in the low-rank part while still allowing task specific personalization using the sparse part. We instantiate and study the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating the sum of a rank- and a -column sparse matrix using a small number of linear measurements. We propose an alternating minimization method with hard thresholding -- AMHT-LRS -- to learn the low-rank and sparse part effectively and efficiently. For the realizable, Gaussian data setting, we show that AMHT-LRS indeed solves the problem efficiently with nearly optimal samples. We extend AMHT-LRS to ensure that it preserves privacy of each individual user in the dataset, while still ensuring strong generalization with nearly optimal number of samples. Finally, on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the framework allows personalized models to obtain superior performance in the data-scarce regime.", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Private and Efficient Meta-Learning with Low Rank and Sparse decomposition", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=708983758514494837&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "S Pal, P Varshney, G Madan, AG Thakurta, G Aggarwal\u2026 - 2022", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:dR3H1fjQ1gkJ:scholar.google.com/"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a5eedb0346ad2dadae5", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/c027f5b7a4e85bbe/66411a5eedb0346ad2dadae5.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:02 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:02 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:naSTrk-c4S8C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/c027f5b7a4e85bbe/66411a5eedb0346ad2dadae5.html", "total_time_taken": 5.52}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:naSTrk-c4S8C"}, "citation": {"title": "Online low rank matrix completion", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03997", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03997"}], "authors": "Prateek Jain, Soumyabrata Pal", "publication_date": "2022/9/8", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.03997", "description": "We study the problem of {\\em online} low-rank matrix completion with users, items and rounds.

The problem can be easily mapped to the standard multi-armed bandit problem where each item is an {\\em independent} arm, but that leads to poor regret as the correlation between arms and users is not exploited. On the other hand, exploiting the low-rank structure of reward matrix is challenging due to non-convexity of the low-rank manifold.

This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 6, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=2987643376523538794&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=2987643376523538794&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "2987643376523538794"}, "table": [{"year": 2023, "citations": 4}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 2}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Treeformer: Dense gradient trees for efficient attention computation", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=2987643376523538794&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "L Madaan, S Bhojanapalli, H Jain, P Jain - arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.09015, 2022", "cited_by": {"total": 6, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=2987643376523538794&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=2987643376523538794&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "2987643376523538794"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:avE7XdI9dikJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=2987643376523538794", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=2987643376523538794&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "2987643376523538794"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a68fdca3eab2cea3d98", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/61fbf1714148b6d0/66411a68fdca3eab2cea3d98.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:12 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:12 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/61fbf1714148b6d0/66411a68fdca3eab2cea3d98.html", "total_time_taken": 1.77}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:c59VksA5Vz4C"}, "citation": {"title": "DAFT: Distilling Adversarially Fine-tuned teachers for OOD Robustness", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=uGSSmEHRino", "resources": [{"title": "from openreview.net", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uGSSmEHRino"}], "authors": "Anshul Nasery, Sravanti Addepalli, Praneeth Netrapalli, Prateek Jain", "publication_date": "2022/7/21", "conference": "ICML 2022: Workshop on Spurious Correlations, Invariance and Stability", "description": "We consider the problem of OOD generalization,where the goal is to train a model that performs well on test distributions that are different from the training distribution.

Typical contrastive learning based SSL methods require instance-wise data augmentations which are difficult to design for unstructured tabular data. Existing tabular-SSL methods design such augmentations in a relatively ad-hoc fashion and can fail to capture the underlying data manifold. Instead of augmentations based approaches for tabular-SSL, we propose a new reconstruction based method, called Masked Encoding for Tabular Data (MET), that does not require augmentations. MET is based on the popular MAE approach for vision-SSL [He et al., 2021] and uses two key ideas: (i) since each coordinate in a tabular dataset has a distinct meaning, we need to use separate representations for all coordinates, and (ii) using an adversarial reconstruction loss in addition to the standard one. Empirical results on five diverse tabular datasets show that MET achieves a new state of the art (SOTA) on all of these datasets and improves up to 9% over current SOTA methods. We shed more light on the working of MET via experiments on carefully designed simple datasets.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 22, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=2939433742922379007&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=2939433742922379007&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "2939433742922379007"}, "table": [{"year": 2022, "citations": 1}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 16}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 5}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Met: Masked encoding for tabular data", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=2939433742922379007&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "K Majmundar, S Goyal, P Netrapalli, P Jain - arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.08564, 2022", "cited_by": {"total": 22, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=2939433742922379007&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=2939433742922379007&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "2939433742922379007"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:_26vV2r3yigJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 5, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=2939433742922379007", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=2939433742922379007&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "2939433742922379007"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a6fea14423e82d1563a", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/9a626ceff0a868ed/66411a6fea14423e82d1563a.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:19 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:19 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/9a626ceff0a868ed/66411a6fea14423e82d1563a.html", "total_time_taken": 1.26}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:SGW5VrABaM0C"}, "citation": {"title": "Robust training in high dimensions via block coordinate geometric median descent", "link": "https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/acharya22a", "resources": [{"title": "from mlr.press", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/acharya22a/acharya22a.pdf"}], "authors": "Anish Acharya, Abolfazl Hashemi, Prateek Jain, Sujay Sanghavi, Inderjit S Dhillon, Ufuk Topcu", "publication_date": "2022/5/3", "conference": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics", "pages": "11145-11168", "publisher": "PMLR", "description": "Geometric median (GM) is a classical method in statistics for achieving robust estimation of the uncorrupted data; under gross corruption, it achieves the optimal breakdown point of 1/2.

In this paper, we show that by applying GM to only a judiciously chosen block of coordinates at a time and using a memory mechanism, one can retain the breakdown point of 1/2 for smooth non-convex problems, with non-asymptotic convergence rates comparable to the SGD with GM while resulting in significant speedup in training. We further validate the run-time and robustness of our approach empirically on several popular deep learning tasks.

When training such representations, it is often the case that computational and statistical constraints for each downstream task are unknown. In this context, rigid fixed-capacity representations can be either over or under-accommodating to the task at hand. This leads us to ask: can we design a flexible representation that can adapt to multiple downstream tasks with varying computational resources? Our main contribution is Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) which encodes information at different granularities and allows a single embedding to adapt to the computational constraints of downstream tasks. MRL minimally modifies existing representation learning pipelines and imposes no additional cost during inference and deployment. MRL learns coarse-to-fine representations that are at least as accurate and rich as independently trained low-dimensional representations. The flexibility within the learned Matryoshka Representations offer:(a) up to 14\u00d7 smaller embedding size for ImageNet-1K classification at the same level of accuracy;(b) up to 14\u00d7 real-world speed-ups for large-scale retrieval on ImageNet-1K and 4K; and (c) up to 2% accuracy improvements for long-tail few-shot classification, all while being as robust as the original representations. Finally, we show that MRL extends seamlessly to web-scale datasets (ImageNet, JFT) across various modalities\u2013vision (ViT, ResNet), vision+ language (ALIGN) and language (BERT).

While the LTI system estimation problem is well-studied in the {\\em offline} setting, the practically important streaming/online setting has received little attention. Standard streaming methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are unlikely to work since streaming points can be highly correlated. In this work, we propose a novel streaming algorithm, SGD with Reverse Experience Replay (SGD-RER), that is inspired by the experience replay (ER) technique popular in the RL literature. SGD-RER divides data into small buffers and runs SGD backwards on the data stored in the individual buffers. We show that this algorithm exactly deconstructs the dependency structure and obtains information theoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error. Thus, we provide the first--to the best of our knowledge--optimal SGD-style algorithm for the classical problem of linear system identification with a first order oracle. Furthermore, SGD-RER can be applied to more general settings like sparse LTI identification with known sparsity pattern, and non-linear dynamical systems. Our work demonstrates that the knowledge of data dependency structure can aid us in designing statistically and computationally efficient algorithms which can``decorrelate''streaming samples.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 17, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1908643955255783965&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=1908643955255783965&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "1908643955255783965"}, "table": [{"year": 2022, "citations": 7}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 8}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 2}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Streaming linear system identification with reverse experience replay", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=1908643955255783965&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "S Kowshik, D Nagaraj, P Jain, P Netrapalli - Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2021", "cited_by": {"total": 17, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1908643955255783965&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=1908643955255783965&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "1908643955255783965"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:HbK3m5DdfBoJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=1908643955255783965", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=1908643955255783965&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "1908643955255783965"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a7779627c7168a94fc9", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/7cf7621b58039a69/66411a7779627c7168a94fc9.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:27 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:27 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/7cf7621b58039a69/66411a7779627c7168a94fc9.html", "total_time_taken": 0.81}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:wvYxNZNCP7wC"}, "citation": {"title": "Statistically and computationally efficient linear meta-representation learning", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/hash/99e7e6ce097324aceb45f98299ceb621-Abstract.html", "resources": [{"title": "from neurips.cc", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/99e7e6ce097324aceb45f98299ceb621-Paper.pdf"}], "authors": "Kiran K Thekumparampil, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli, Sewoong Oh", "publication_date": "2021/12/6", "journal": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "volume": "34", "pages": "18487-18500", "description": "In typical few-shot learning, each task is not equipped with enough data to be learned in isolation.

In this work, we test the validity of assumption (A) using a three-pronged approach: 1. We develop an evaluation framework, DiffROAR, to test assumption (A) on four image classification benchmarks. Our results suggest that (i) input gradients of standard models (ie, trained on original data) may grossly violate (A), whereas (ii) input gradients of adversarially robust models satisfy (A). 2. We then introduce BlockMNIST, an MNIST-based semi-real dataset, that by design encodes a priori knowledge of discriminative features. Our analysis on BlockMNIST leverages this information to validate as well as characterize differences between input gradient attributions of standard and robust models. 3. Finally, we theoretically prove that our empirical findings hold on a simplified version of the BlockMNIST dataset. Specifically, we prove that input gradients of standard one-hidden-layer MLPs trained on this dataset do not highlight instance-specific signal coordinates, thus grossly violating assumption (A). Our findings motivate the need to formalize and test common assumptions in interpretability in a falsifiable manner [Leavitt and Morcos, 2020].

However, this aggregation implies an increased risk of revealing sensitive information, as a node can participate in the inference for multiple nodes. This implies that standard privacy-preserving machine learning techniques, such as differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) - which are designed for situations where each data point participates in the inference for one point only - either do not apply, or lead to inaccurate models. In this work, we formally define the problem of learning GNN parameters with node-level privacy, and provide an algorithmic solution with a strong differential privacy guarantee. We employ a careful sensitivity analysis and provide a non-trivial extension of the privacy-by-amplification technique to the GNN setting. An empirical evaluation on standard benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method is indeed able to learn accurate privacy-preserving GNNs which outperform both private and non-private methods that completely ignore graph information.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 38, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=10231790179534332853&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=10231790179534332853&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "10231790179534332853"}, "table": [{"year": 2022, "citations": 8}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 21}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 9}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Node-level differentially private graph neural networks", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=10231790179534332853&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "A Daigavane, G Madan, A Sinha, AG Thakurta\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.15521, 2021", "cited_by": {"total": 38, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=10231790179534332853&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=10231790179534332853&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "10231790179534332853"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:tWN5O_We_o0J:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 4, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=10231790179534332853", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=10231790179534332853&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "10231790179534332853"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a803c3fb2a4bd900f44", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/2a9597648e4452ff/66411a803c3fb2a4bd900f44.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:36 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:36 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/2a9597648e4452ff/66411a803c3fb2a4bd900f44.html", "total_time_taken": 4.62}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:VN7nJs4JPk0C"}, "citation": {"title": "Message recommendation system", "link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/US11184301B2/en", "resources": [{"title": "from googleapis.com", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d1/34/42/d5bd9896ec9e37/US11184301.pdf"}], "inventors": "Lekshmi Menon, Amar Budhiraja, Gaurush Hiranandani, Prateek Jain, Darshatkumar Anandji Shah, Ayush Choure, Navya Yarrabelly, Anurag Mishra, Mohammad Luqman, Shivangi Dhakad, Juhi Dua", "publication_date": "2021/11/23", "patent_office": "US", "patent_number": "11184301", "application_number": "16541818", "description": "Systems and methods for entity recommendation can make use of rich data by allowing the items to be recommended and the recipients of the recommendation (eg, users) to be modeled as \u201ccomplex entities\u201d composed of one or more static sub-entities and/or a dynamic component, and by utilizing information about multiple relationships between the sub-entities as reflected in bipartite graphs.

In contrast, existing theoretical results are pessimistic about Q-learning. For example, (Baird, 1995) shows that Q-learning does not converge even with linear function approximation for linear MDPs. Furthermore, even for tabular MDPs with synchronous updates, Q-learning was shown to have sub-optimal sample complexity (Li et al., 2021;Azar et al., 2013). The goal of this work is to bridge the gap between practical success of Q-learning and the relatively pessimistic theoretical results. The starting point of our work is the observation that in practice, Q-learning is used with two important modifications: (i) training with two networks, called online network and target network simultaneously (online target learning, or OTL) , and (ii) experience replay (ER) (Mnih et al., 2015). While they have been observed to play a significant role in the practical success of Q-learning, a thorough theoretical understanding of how these two modifications improve the convergence behavior of Q-learning has been missing in literature. By carefully combining Q-learning with OTL and reverse experience replay (RER) (a form of experience replay), we present novel methods Q-Rex and Q-RexDaRe (Q-Rex + data reuse). We show that Q-Rex efficiently finds the optimal policy for linear MDPs (or more generally for MDPs with zero inherent Bellman error with linear approximation (ZIBEL)) and provide non-asymptotic bounds on sample complexity -- the first such result for a Q-learning method for this class of MDPs under standard \u2026", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 23, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=18284937111633047201&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=18284937111633047201&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "18284937111633047201"}, "table": [{"year": 2021, "citations": 2}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 12}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 9}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Online target q-learning with reverse experience replay: Efficiently finding the optimal policy for linear mdps", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=18284937111633047201&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "N Agarwal, S Chaudhuri, P Jain, D Nagaraj\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.08440, 2021", "cited_by": {"total": 23, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=18284937111633047201&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=18284937111633047201&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "18284937111633047201"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:oa4-32wlwf0J:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 5, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=18284937111633047201", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=18284937111633047201&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "18284937111633047201"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a884055aa2be782817d", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/3b531d55a152160c/66411a884055aa2be782817d.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:44 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:44 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/3b531d55a152160c/66411a884055aa2be782817d.html", "total_time_taken": 0.27}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:QsaTk4IG4EwC"}, "citation": {"title": "Iglu: Efficient GCN training via lazy updates", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13995", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13995"}], "authors": "S Deepak Narayanan, Aditya Sinha, Prateek Jain, Purushottam Kar, Sundararajan Sellamanickam", "publication_date": "2021/9/28", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.13995", "description": "Training multi-layer Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) using standard SGD techniques scales poorly as each descent step ends up updating node embeddings for a large portion of the graph.

While the LTI system estimation problem is well-studied in the {\\em offline} setting, the practically important streaming/online setting has received little attention. Standard streaming methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are unlikely to work since streaming points can be highly correlated. In this work, we propose a novel streaming algorithm, SGD with Reverse Experience Replay (), that is inspired by the experience replay (ER) technique popular in the RL literature. divides data into small buffers and runs SGD backwards on the data stored in the individual buffers. We show that this algorithm exactly deconstructs the dependency structure and obtains information theoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error. Thus, we provide the first -- to the best of our knowledge -- optimal SGD-style algorithm for the classical problem of linear system identification with a first order oracle. Furthermore, can be applied to more general settings like sparse LTI identification with known sparsity pattern, and non-linear dynamical systems.

Using extensive validation on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method provides best of both worlds, i.e., it is competitive to, and in some cases more accurate than methods designed \\textit{specifically} for the supervised settings; and in bandit settings, where most existing tree learning techniques are not applicable, our models are still accurate and significantly outperform the applicable SOTA methods.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 11, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=3696744630184214249&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=3696744630184214249&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "3696744630184214249"}, "table": [{"year": 2021, "citations": 1}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 4}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 5}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 1}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Learning accurate decision trees with bandit feedback via quantized gradient descent", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=3696744630184214249&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "A Karthikeyan, N Jain, N Natarajan, P Jain - arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07567, 2021", "cited_by": {"total": 11, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=3696744630184214249&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=3696744630184214249&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "3696744630184214249"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:6X52q6d5TTMJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 5, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=3696744630184214249", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=3696744630184214249&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "3696744630184214249"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411a943944b08e2a62567e", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/6007085ff42f31ba/66411a943944b08e2a62567e.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:56 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:37:56 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/6007085ff42f31ba/66411a943944b08e2a62567e.html", "total_time_taken": 1.65}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:natZJ_-F0IUC"}, "citation": {"title": "Making the last iterate of sgd information theoretically optimal", "link": "https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/19M128908X", "authors": "Prateek Jain, Dheeraj M Nagaraj, Praneeth Netrapalli", "publication_date": "2021", "journal": "SIAM Journal on Optimization", "volume": "31", "issue": "2", "pages": "1108-1130", "publisher": "Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics", "description": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most widely used algorithms for large-scale optimization problems.

State-of-the-art methods aim to leverage deep learning to learn appropriate features via two main approaches. The first approach based on predicting transformations (Golan & El-Yaniv, 2018; Hendrycks et al., 2019a) while successful in some domains, crucially depends on an appropriate domain-specific set of transformations that are hard to obtain in general. The second approach of minimizing a classical one-class loss on the learned final layer representations, eg, DeepSVDD (Ruff et al., 2018) suffers from the fundamental drawback of representation collapse. In this work, we propose Deep Robust One Class Classification (DROCC) that is both applicable to most standard domains without requiring any side-information and robust to representation collapse. DROCC is based on the assumption that the points from the class of interest lie on a well-sampled, locally linear low dimensional manifold. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that DROCC is highly effective in two different one-class problem settings and on a range of real-world datasets across different domains: tabular data, images (CIFAR and ImageNet), audio, and time-series, offering up to 20% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art in anomaly detection.

Existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic non-uniform sparsity budgets which have sub-optimal layer-wise parameter allocation resulting in a) lower prediction accuracy or b) higher inference cost (FLOPs). This work proposes Soft Threshold Reparameterization (STR), a novel use of the soft-threshold operator on DNN weights. STR smoothly induces sparsity while learning pruning thresholds thereby obtaining a non-uniform sparsity budget. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for unstructured sparsity in CNNs (ResNet50 and MobileNetV1 on ImageNet-1K), and, additionally, learns non-uniform budgets that empirically reduce the FLOPs by up to 50%. Notably, STR boosts the accuracy over existing results by up to 10% in the ultra sparse (99%) regime and can also be used to induce low-rank (structured sparsity) in RNNs. In short, STR is a simple mechanism which learns effective sparsity budgets that contrast with popular heuristics.

The goal of the synthesizer is to synthesize a \"decision function\" which transforms the features to a decision value for the black-box component so as to maximize the expected reward for executing decisions for various values of . We consider a space of decision functions in a DSL of loop-free if-then-else programs, which can branch on linear functions of the input features in a tree-structure and compute a linear function of the inputs in the leaves of the tree.

Our technical contribution is the use of continuous-optimization techniques to perform synthesis of such decision functions as if-then-else programs.

IRLS is known to offer excellent performance, despite bad initializations and data corruption, for several parameter estimation problems. Existing analyses of IRLS frequently require careful initialization, thus offering only local convergence guarantees. We remedy this by proposing augmentations to the basic IRLS routine that not only offer guaranteed global recovery, but in practice also outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for robust regression.

We provide a general formulation for the problem that captures the complexities of modern real-world recommendations and generalizes many existing formulations. In our formulation, each user/document that requires a recommendation and each item or tag that is to be recommended, both are modeled by a set of static entities and a dynamic component. The relationships between entities are captured by several weighted bipartite graphs. To effectively exploit these complex interactions and learn the recommendation model, we propose MEDRES- a multiple graph-CNN based novel deep-learning architecture. MEDRES uses AL-GCN, a novel graph convolution network block, that harnesses strong representative features from the underlying graphs. Moreover, in order to capture highly heterogeneous engagement of different users with the system and constraints on the number of items to be recommended, we propose a novel ranking metric pAp@k along with a method to optimize the metric directly. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method on two benchmarks: a) citation data, b) Flickr data. In addition, we present two real-world case studies of our formulation and the MEDRES architecture. We show how our technique can be used to naturally model the message recommendation problem and the teams recommendation problem in the Microsoft Teams (MSTeams) product and demonstrate that it is 5-6% points more \u2026", "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Rich-Item Recommendations for Rich-Users: Exploiting Dynamic and Static Side Information", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=6300227030284588255&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "A Budhiraja, G Hiranandani, D Chhatbar, A Sinha\u2026 - arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.10495, 2020", "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:31RtoBrnblcJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 3, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=6300227030284588255", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=6300227030284588255&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "6300227030284588255"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411aada4bb3890620203d8", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/87fef5f15257113d/66411aada4bb3890620203d8.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:21 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:21 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/87fef5f15257113d/66411aada4bb3890620203d8.html", "total_time_taken": 1.79}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:jE2MZjpN3IcC"}, "citation": {"title": "Optimal nonsmooth Frank-Wolfe method for stochastic regret minimization", "link": "http://www.opt-ml.org/papers/2020/paper_101.pdf", "resources": [{"title": "from opt-ml.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "http://www.opt-ml.org/papers/2020/paper_101.pdf"}], "authors": "Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli, Sewoong Oh", "publication_date": "2020", "journal": "12th OPT Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning (OPT2020)", "description": "The current best-known algorithm for convex constrained nonsmooth online stochastic regret minimization using a Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO, a la Frank-Wolfe) and a Stochastic First-order Oracle (SFO) achieves a regret of O (K3/4), where K is the number of iterations [26].

It is well known that to achieve -suboptimality in high-dimensions, FO calls are necessary. This is achieved by the projected subgradient method (PGD). However, PGD also entails PO calls, which may be computationally costlier than FO calls (eg nuclear norm constraints). Improving this PO calls complexity of PGD is largely unexplored, despite the fundamental nature of this problem and extensive literature. We present first such improvement. This only requires a mild assumption that the objective function, when extended to a slightly larger neighborhood of the constraint set, still remains Lipschitz and accessible via FO. In particular, we introduce MOPES method, which carefully combines Moreau-Yosida smoothing and accelerated first-order schemes. This is guaranteed to find a feasible -suboptimal solution using only PO calls and optimal FO calls. Further, instead of a PO if we only have a linear minimization oracle (LMO, a la Frank-Wolfe) to access the constraint set, an extension of our method, MOLES, finds a feasible -suboptimal solution using LMO calls and FO calls---both match known lower bounds, resolving a question left open since White (1993).

We establish sharp information theoretic minimax lower bounds for this problem in terms of $\\tmix $, the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain, under different noise settings. Our results establish that in general, optimization with Markovian data is strictly harder than optimization with independent data and a trivial algorithm (SGD-DD) that works with only one in every $\\tmix $ samples, which are approximately independent, is minimax optimal. In fact, it is strictly better than the popular Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method with constant step-size which is otherwise minimax optimal in the regression with independent data setting. Beyond a worst case analysis, we investigate whether structured datasets seen in practice such as Gaussian auto-regressive dynamics can admit more efficient optimization schemes. Surprisingly, even in this specific and natural setting, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with constant step-size is still no better than SGD-DD. Instead, we propose an algorithm based on experience replay--a popular reinforcement learning technique--that achieves a significantly better error rate.

However, the precise notion of simplicity remains vague. Furthermore, previous settings [Soudry et al. 2018, Gunasekar et al. 2018] that use SB to theoretically justify why neural networks generalize well do not simultaneously capture the non-robustness of neural networks---a widely observed phenomenon in practice [Goodfellow et al. 2014, Jo and Bengio 2017]. We attempt to reconcile SB and the superior standard generalization of neural networks with the non-robustness observed in practice by introducing piecewise-linear and image-based datasets, which (a) incorporate a precise notion of simplicity,(b) comprise multiple predictive features with varying levels of simplicity, and (c) capture the non-robustness of neural networks trained on real data. Using theory and empirics on these datasets, we make four observations:(i) SB of SGD and variants can be extreme: neural networks can exclusively rely on the simplest feature and remain invariant to all predictive complex features.(ii) The extreme aspect of SB could explain why seemingly benign distribution shifts and small adversarial perturbations significantly degrade model performance.(iii) Contrary to conventional wisdom, SB can also hurt generalization on the same data distribution, as SB persists even when the simplest feature has less predictive power than the more complex features.(iv) Common approaches to \u2026", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 316, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=13128598861891549872&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=13128598861891549872&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "13128598861891549872"}, "table": [{"year": 2020, "citations": 5}, {"year": 2021, "citations": 50}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 86}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 128}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 46}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "The pitfalls of simplicity bias in neural networks", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=13128598861891549872&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "H Shah, K Tamuly, A Raghunathan, P Jain, P Netrapalli - Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020", "cited_by": {"total": 316, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=13128598861891549872&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=13128598861891549872&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "13128598861891549872"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sLqkSRsnMrYJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 7, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=13128598861891549872", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=13128598861891549872&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "13128598861891549872"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411ab21e803f0832e5721e", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/dea45ab727ec02ea/66411ab21e803f0832e5721e.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:26 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:26 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/dea45ab727ec02ea/66411ab21e803f0832e5721e.html", "total_time_taken": 1.41}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:MpfHP-DdYjUC"}, "citation": {"title": "RNNPool: Efficient non-linear pooling for RAM constrained inference", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/hash/ebd9629fc3ae5e9f6611e2ee05a31cef-Abstract.html", "resources": [{"title": "from neurips.cc", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/ebd9629fc3ae5e9f6611e2ee05a31cef-Paper.pdf"}], "authors": "Oindrila Saha, Aditya Kusupati, Harsha Vardhan Simhadri, Manik Varma, Prateek Jain", "publication_date": "2020", "journal": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems", "volume": "33", "pages": "20473-20484", "description": "Standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) designed for computer vision tasks tend to have large intermediate activation maps. These require large working memory and are thus unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices typically used for inference on the edge. Aggressively downsampling the images via pooling or strided convolutions can address the problem but leads to a significant decrease in accuracy due to gross aggregation of the feature map by standard pooling operators. In this paper, we introduce RNNPool, a novel pooling operator based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that efficiently aggregates features over large patches of an image and rapidly downsamples activation maps. Empirical evaluation indicates that an RNNPool layer can effectively replace multiple blocks in a variety of architectures such as MobileNets, DenseNet when applied to standard vision tasks like image classification and face detection. That is, RNNPool can significantly decrease computational complexity and peak memory usage for inference while retaining comparable accuracy. We use RNNPool with the standard S3FD architecture to construct a face detection method that achieves state-of-the-art MAP for tiny ARM Cortex-M4 class microcontrollers with under 256 KB of RAM.

However, the sequential nature of RNNs dictates a large inference cost for long sequences even if the hardware supports parallelization. To induce long-term dependencies, and yet admit parallelization, we introduce novel shallow RNNs. In this architecture, the first layer splits the input sequence and runs several independent RNNs. The second layer consumes the output of the first layer using a second RNN thus capturing long dependencies. We provide theoretical justification for our architecture under weak assumptions that we verify on real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that for time-series classification, our technique leads to substantially improved inference time over standard RNNs without compromising accuracy. For example, we can deploy audio-keyword classification on tiny Cortex M4 devices (100MHz processor, 256KB RAM, no DSP available) which was not possible using standard RNN models. Similarly, using ShaRNN in the popular Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) architecture for phoneme classification [4], we can reduce the lag in phoneme classification by 10-12x while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 15, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=18441677415241659339&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=18441677415241659339&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "18441677415241659339"}, "table": [{"year": 2021, "citations": 3}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 7}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 3}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 2}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Shallow RNNs: A method for accurate time-series classification on tiny devices", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=18441677415241659339&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "DK Dennis, DAE Acar, V Mandikal, VS Sadasivan\u2026 - Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on \u2026, 2019", "cited_by": {"total": 15, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=18441677415241659339&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=18441677415241659339&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "18441677415241659339"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:y7PSpeb_7f8J:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 10, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=18441677415241659339", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=18441677415241659339&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "18441677415241659339"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411ab7eb690f43da4061ca", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/69399ead069df2d5/66411ab7eb690f43da4061ca.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:31 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:31 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/69399ead069df2d5/66411ab7eb690f43da4061ca.html", "total_time_taken": 0.73}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C"}, "citation": {"title": "On Scaling Data-Driven Loop Invariant Inference", "link": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11728", "resources": [{"title": "from arxiv.org", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11728"}], "authors": "Sahil Bhatia, Saswat Padhi, Nagarajan Natarajan, Rahul Sharma, Prateek Jain", "publication_date": "2019/11/26", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.11728", "description": "Automated synthesis of inductive invariants is an important problem in software verification.

However, to ensure invariance with respect to permutations of set elements, we propose a novel architecture called SPAN that simultaneously learns the function as well as adversarial or worst-case permutations for each input set. The learning problem reduces to a min-max optimization problem that is solved via a simple alternating block coordinate descent technique. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of set-learning tasks and demonstrate that SPAN learns nearly permutation-invariant functions while still ensuring accuracy on test data. On a variety of tasks sampled from the domains of statistics, graph functions and linear algebra, we show that our method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods such as DeepSets and Janossy Pooling. Finally, we present a case study of how learning set-functions can help extract powerful features for recommendation systems, and show that such a method can be as much as 2% more accurate than carefully hand-tuned features on a real-world recommendation system.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 8, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15007630510686435832&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=15007630510686435832&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "15007630510686435832"}, "table": [{"year": 2020, "citations": 1}, {"year": 2021, "citations": 4}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 3}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Learning functions over sets via permutation adversarial networks", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=15007630510686435832&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "C Pabbaraju, P Jain - arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.05638, 2019", "cited_by": {"total": 8, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=15007630510686435832&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=15007630510686435832&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "15007630510686435832"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:-HnHhW_QRdAJ:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 2, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=15007630510686435832", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=15007630510686435832&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "15007630510686435832"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411ac23d691906fb20d3e9", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4ef05d5238d8095b/66411ac23d691906fb20d3e9.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:42 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:42 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/4ef05d5238d8095b/66411ac23d691906fb20d3e9.html", "total_time_taken": 0.25}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC"}, "citation": {"title": "Efficient Algorithms for Smooth Minimax Optimization", "link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190701543K/abstract", "authors": "Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli, Sewoong Oh", "publication_date": "2019/7", "journal": "arXiv e-prints", "pages": "arXiv: 1907.01543", "description": "This paper studies first order methods for solving smooth minimax optimization problems where is smooth and is concave for each .

While classical theoretical analysis of SGD for convex problems studies (suffix)\\emph {averages} of iterates and obtains information theoretically optimal bounds on suboptimality, the\\emph {last point} of SGD is, by far, the most preferred choice in practice. The best known results for last point of SGD (Shamir and Zhang, 2013) however, are suboptimal compared to information theoretic lower bounds by a factor, where is the number of iterations. Harvey et. al (2018) shows that in fact, this additional factor is tight for standard step size sequences of $\\OTheta {\\frac {1}{\\sqrt {t}}} $ and $\\OTheta {\\frac {1}{t}} $ for non-strongly convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Similarly, even for subgradient descent (GD) when applied to non-smooth, convex functions, the best known step-size sequences still lead to -suboptimal convergence rates (on the final iterate). The main contribution of this work is to design new step size sequences that enjoy information theoretically optimal bounds on the suboptimality of\\emph {last point} of SGD as well as GD. We achieve this by designing a modification scheme, that converts one sequence of step sizes to another so that the last point of SGD/GD with modified sequence has the same suboptimality guarantees as the average of SGD/GD with original sequence. We also show that our result holds with high-probability.

By using method of exchangeable pairs to bound Wasserstein distance, we provide the first non-asymptotic results for SGDo when applied to general smooth, strongly-convex functions. In particular, we show that SGDo converges at a rate of while SGD is known to converge at rate, where denotes the number of passes over data and is required to be large enough.

In addition, by careful analysis of the coupling, for both large and small , we obtain better dependence on problem dependent parameters like condition number.", "total_citations": {"cited_by": {"total": 70, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=10242898150506844810&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=10242898150506844810&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "10242898150506844810"}, "table": [{"year": 2019, "citations": 2}, {"year": 2020, "citations": 9}, {"year": 2021, "citations": 20}, {"year": 2022, "citations": 14}, {"year": 2023, "citations": 15}, {"year": 2024, "citations": 10}]}, "scholar_articles": [{"title": "Sgd without replacement: Sharper rates for general smooth convex functions", "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=10242898150506844810&btnI=1&hl=en", "authors": "D Nagaraj, P Jain, P Netrapalli - International Conference on Machine Learning, 2019", "cited_by": {"total": 70, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=10242898150506844810&as_sdt=5", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cites=10242898150506844810&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cites_id": "10242898150506844810"}, "related_pages_link": {"link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ilJ3Q5kVJo4J:scholar.google.com/"}, "versions": {"total": 8, "link": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cluster=10242898150506844810", "serpapi_link": "https://serpapi.com/search.json?cluster=10242898150506844810&engine=google_scholar&hl=en", "cluster_id": "10242898150506844810"}}]}}, {"search_metadata": {"id": "66411ad3cace96fa7f988b31", "status": "Success", "json_endpoint": "https://serpapi.com/searches/22cf1fde69b0eb64/66411ad3cace96fa7f988b31.json", "created_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:59 UTC", "processed_at": "2024-05-12 19:38:59 UTC", "google_scholar_author_url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=view_citation&citation_for_view=qYhRbJoAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC", "raw_html_file": "https://serpapi.com/searches/22cf1fde69b0eb64/66411ad3cace96fa7f988b31.html", "total_time_taken": 1.15}, "search_parameters": {"engine": "google_scholar_author", "hl": "en", "view_op": "view_citation", "citation_id": "qYhRbJoAAAAJ:P7Ujq4OLJYoC"}, "citation": {"title": "Universality Patterns in the Training of Neural Networks", "link": "https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1e2wNB3hV", "resources": [{"title": "from openreview.net", "file_format": "PDF", "link": "https://openreview.net/pdf?id=H1e2wNB3hV"}], "authors": "Raghav Somani, Navin Goyal, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli", "publication_date": "2019/5/17", "description": "This paper proposes and demonstrates a surprising pattern in the training of neural networks: there is a one to one relation between the values of any pair of losses (such as cross entropy, mean squared error, 0/1 error etc.) evaluated for a model arising at (any point of) a training run.
