I lead the Machine Learning Foundations and Optimization team at Google AI, Bangalore, India. My research interests are in machine learning, non-convex optimization, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization algorithms in general. I am also interested in applications of machine learning to privacy, computer vision, text mining and natural language processing.

Earlier, I was a Sr. Principal Research Scientist at Microsoft Research India. I completed my PhD at the University of Texas at Austin under Prof. Inderjit S. Dhillon.
